# TCS-iON_Internship (Ranking-Features-of-a-Smartphone)
Rank Features of a Smartphone - Build a Python Application to Classify and Rank Dataset 


The objective of this project is to build a python application that classifies the price range category to which the smartphone falls and also to rank the features of a smartphone.

The dataset has 2000 rows and 21 features of a smart phone. To proceed with this dataset for the given problem of ranking smartphone features based on user requests, you can follow these steps:

- Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.
- Explore the dataset using statistical analysis and visualization to understand the distribution of the features and their relationships with each other.
- Identify the most important features using feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, mutual information, and feature importance scores from machine learning models.
- Rank the features based on their importance scores.
- Implement a user interface to collect feature requests from users and update the feature ranking based on the user feedback.
